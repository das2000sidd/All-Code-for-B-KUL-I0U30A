# All-Code-for-B-KUL-I0U30A
These are python and linux codes for the class mentioned above at University of Leuven. It demonstrates some of my python and linux work relevant to bioinformatics.
The genbankParsing.py scripts takes a genbank text file and uses regular expression to extract various information from a genbank text file using regular expression.
The extractingCDS.py script takes a fasta and finds the open reading frames using regular expressions  and finds the longest ORF.
The countingCodons&Translation.py script takes a file with multilple fasta sequence identified by headers and finds amino acid composition of the various fasta after translating them as well as identify sequenceds matching motifs using regular expressions.
